# Mass Delete

## About
Mass Delete permits the facile deletion of multiple records from a REDCap project

The module must be enabled for each project and then respects the user's DAG and also filters by arm.

This module can also delete specified forms and not the whole record.  The forms can be repeating or non-repeating. 
If a form for a record is blank, it will skip that form and continue with the next form or record.

## Caution
Exercise caution as this REALLY deletes records and/or forms!
